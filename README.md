# Who Calls Dibs? 
## Mobile-Optimized UI with Device-Agnostic Functionality

## User Story
As an individual decluttering my physical environment, before dropping off items I no longer need to a donation center, I would like to give my family and friends the opportunity to view and call dibs on any items they want so that I can connect with them through secondhand gift giving while reducing waste created by unwanted gifts.

##### Currently Implemented:
- As an item owner, I would like to upload the item name, image(s) and description for my connections to view
- As an item seeker, I would like to view items and, if interested, I want to "call dibs" to notify the item owner
- As an item owner, I would like to receive an email notification when dibs are called on my items
- As an item owner, I would like to categorize the item I am uploading to help others' find what they want efficiently
- As an item seeker, I would like to filter my connections' items for categories I am interested in to find what I want efficiently
- As a user, I want to add my friends and family so that my item sharing experience is comfortably limited to people I know and trust
- As an item owner, I want to view lists of items I have uploaded, whether they have dibs called on them and by who, and whether they have been sent and received
- As an item seeker, I want to view which items I have called dibs on and indicate when I have received them
  
##### Future Roadmap:
- As an item owner, I would like to specify how long an item should be listed before it expires
- As an item seeker, I want to see how long I have to claim an item until the listing expires
- As an item owner, if my item expires without dibs called on it, I would like to receive an email notification so that I can donate it locally instead
- As an item seeker and owner, I would like to create and join groups
- As an item owner, I would like to specify which friends I share certain items with
